## Whoami

I am invested in peer-learning. Trying to help others as much as possible and learn from others too.
If you are a student and came here to get some help on your project, a better way to do it would be to go and talk to your peers! You can send me a message too.  
I am currently working on ethical offensive security projects on private repositories, and hidden for obvious reasons.  
If you are a curious wanderer, this self branding is a still a work in progress, I invest my time in learning new stuff way more than promoting myself.
Therefore you will find more information about me if you come talk to me!
